			'Primošten is a village and municipality in Šibenik-Knin County, Croatia. During the Turkish invasions in 1542 the islet was protected by the walls and towers and a draw bridge connected it to the mainland. When the Turks retreated, the draw bridge was replaced by the causeway and in 1564 the settlement was named Primošten after the Croatian verb primostiti (to bridge). The city is famous for its huge and beautiful vineyards.',
